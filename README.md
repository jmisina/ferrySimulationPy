# ferrySimulationPy
A simple console application showcasing a simulation of a ferry traveling over a river, using threading library to simulate parallel processes.  
The river ferry allows 5 cars on board, or if there are too few cars, it waits for
30 seconds. Then it sails to the other shore, releases the cars, and returns
empty. Cars board the ferry one after another in sequential order. Cars arrive at the shore
in given interval of 5 to 8 seconds.  
  
  
Certain parameters of the simulation can be modified, such as ferry capacity, wait time, or car arrival intervals.
